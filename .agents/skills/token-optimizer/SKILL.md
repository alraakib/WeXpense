# Token Optimizer

A comprehensive toolkit to reduce token consumption and lower AI costs — for both **Claude Code users** (file organization, CLAUDE.md, context hygiene) and **API developers** (prompt caching, Batch API, effort tuning, prompt architecture). Recommendations are backed by real experiment data and current Anthropic pricing.

**Which sections apply to you:**
- Using Claude Code? → Sections 1-5 and the Quick Wins Checklist.
- Calling the Anthropic API directly? → Also read `references/api-optimization-guide.md`. That's where the biggest savings live (prompt caching = 90% off, Batch API = 50% off, stackable).

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add amunozdev/token-optimizer
```

Or manually:

```bash
cp -r token-optimizer ~/.claude/skills/
```

## Core Features

### 1. File Organization Optimization

The single highest-impact optimization. Small, focused files reduce token consumption by 18.2% and noise by 92% on focused tasks (the majority of daily development work).

**Core rules:**
- Maximum 150 lines per file — split by responsibility if longer
- Single responsibility — one concern per file
- Descriptive names in kebab-case — the filename tells the AI exactly what's inside

**Real example:** Fixing an email validation bug required reading 814 lines in a monolithic file (49,466 tokens) vs only 67 lines in a modular setup (40,447 tokens) — **18.2% savings, 92% less noise**.

> For naming conventions, avoid/prefer tables, and project structure templates, see `references/file-organization-guide.md`

### 2. CLAUDE.md Optimization

A well-structured CLAUDE.md can reduce token consumption by 50-70%. Most projects have bloated CLAUDE.md files that load unnecessary context on every interaction.

**Key principles:**
- Keep it under 500 lines — essentials only
- Be specific — "PostgreSQL with Prisma" not just "database"
- Include project structure and commands — save the AI from guessing
- Use triggers, not full docs — reference skills/files for details, don't inline everything

### 3. Context Management

Token waste often comes from accumulated irrelevant context, not from individual operations.

**Essential commands:**

| Command | When to Use | Effect |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| `/clear` | Switching tasks, after major corrections | Resets context completely |
| `/compact` | Long conversation (>50 exchanges) | Compresses history, keeps essentials |
| `/context` | Diagnosing high token use | Shows what's consuming tokens |

**Lazy loading:** Don't front-load all information. One project achieved **54% reduction** in initial tokens (7,584 → 3,434) by keeping only triggers in CLAUDE.md and loading details on demand.

> For advanced strategies, subagent patterns, and MCP management, see `references/context-management-guide.md`

### 4. Strategic Model Selection

Choosing the right model per task type is one of the easiest cost savings to implement.

| Task Type | Model | Why |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| 80% of daily tasks | Sonnet | Best cost/performance ratio |
| Complex architecture | Opus | Deeper reasoning needed |
| Simple/quick tasks | Haiku | Up to 18x cheaper than Opus |

Default to Sonnet. Escalate to Opus only for genuinely complex problems. Use Haiku for simple tasks, tests, and searches.

### 5. MCP & Subagent Optimization

**MCP Management:**
- Keep maximum 10 active MCPs at a time (max 80 total tools)
- Disable MCPs not needed for the current task
- Each unused MCP still costs tokens in tool descriptions

**Subagents for verbose tasks:** Use the Task tool for operations that generate large output (test runs, builds, searches). The verbose output stays in the subagent's context — only the summary returns to your main conversation.

### 6. Prompt Architecture (Claude Code and API)

How you write prompts has a direct, measurable impact on tokens — in both directions.

- **Be direct, put the ask first, say it once.** Repetition doesn't increase compliance, it just bills.
- **Constrain output explicitly.** "Under 50 words", "max 3 bullets", "JSON with keys X, Y, Z, no explanation." Open-ended prompts produce open-ended (expensive) responses.
- **Use XML tags** (`<instructions>`, `<context>`, `<output_format>`) to reduce ambiguity.
- **Include only relevant context.** Don't paste 500 lines when one function is enough.

### 7. API-Only Optimizations

If you're calling the Anthropic API directly (SDK, custom agents, production apps), these are **the highest-impact levers** — most are absent when using Claude Code because the harness handles them for you.

| Technique | Savings | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Prompt caching** | 90% on cached reads | Cache writes cost 1.25x, reads 0.1x. Pays for itself on 2nd call. |
| **Batch API** | 50% on all tokens | <24h latency. Stacks with caching → up to 95% total. |
| **`effort: low`** | Large reduction | Skip deep reasoning for classification/extraction. |
| **`budget_tokens` cap** | Proportional | 8K-16K is plenty for most tasks. Don't use 100K to format a date. |
| **Prefill assistant turn** | Removes preamble | `{"role": "assistant", "content": "{"}` skips "Sure! Here's…". |
| **Token-efficient tools** | ~14% output avg | Default in Claude 4. Add `token-efficient-tools-2025-02-19` header for 3.7. |
| **Dynamic tool loading** | Scales with tool count | Every tool schema ships in every request. Only include what the task needs. |
| **Token counting endpoint** | Debugging | Get exact cost before running inference. |

**Critical cache gotchas:**
- **Images break the cache.** Adding or removing an image anywhere in the prompt invalidates it. If your flow sometimes sends images, treat it as a separate request pattern.
- **Anything before the cache breakpoint must be stable.** Timestamps, session IDs, or the user message placed before the breakpoint defeat caching entirely — you pay the 1.25x write surcharge every time with zero reads.
- **Concurrency pitfall.** Cache entries become available only after the first response starts streaming. Fire-and-forget 10 parallel requests → 9 cache misses. Fire one, wait for stream to start, then fan out.
- **Mind the minimum token threshold** per breakpoint (2,048 for Sonnet 4.6; 4,096 for Opus 4.6 and Haiku 4.5). Below it, nothing caches and no error is raised. Verify `cache_creation_input_tokens` in the response.

## Quick Wins Checklist

Apply these in order of impact:

1. **Run `/context` first** → establishes your baseline before any changes
2. **Split large files** (>150 lines) into focused modules → saves 18%+ tokens
3. **Optimize your CLAUDE.md** → can reduce consumption 50-70%
4. **Use `/clear` between tasks** → eliminates irrelevant context
5. **Use `/compact` in long conversations** → compresses history
6. **Use subagents for verbose tasks** → test output, build logs, and search results stay in subagent context instead of polluting your main conversation
7. **Use the right model** → default to Sonnet for daily work, Haiku for simple tasks (18x cheaper than Opus), Opus only for genuinely complex architecture decisions
8. **Limit active MCPs** to ≤10 → each unused MCP still costs tokens every turn because its tool descriptions are sent in every request
9. **Track cost with `/cost`** → use it to see spend per session; configure the statusline to display it continuously
10. **API users: enable prompt caching** → `cache_control` on system prompt and tools = 90% off on repeated input; see `references/api-optimization-guide.md`

## Expected Savings

Results from our controlled experiment with an 814-line TypeScript e-commerce app:

| Optimization | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| Modular files (focused tasks) | **-18.2% tokens** |
| Noise reduction (lines processed) | **-92%** |
| Optimized CLAUDE.md | **-50-70% consumption** |
| Lazy loading context | **-54% initial tokens** |
| Haiku vs Opus (simple tasks) | **-94% cost** |

**Key insight:** Focused tasks (bug fixes, specific changes — ~80% of daily work) benefit enormously from modular code. Cross-cutting tasks show minimal difference at small scale (+1-5%) but modular wins decisively at 5,000+ lines.

**Note on scale:** These results are from a controlled experiment with an 814-line codebase. At larger scales (5,000+ lines), the savings from modular architecture are even more significant because monolithic files start hitting context window limits while modular files maintain constant size (35-146 lines each).

## Diagnostic Workflow

When activated, follow this process:

0. **Measure first**: Always start by asking the user to run `/context`. Without a baseline number, you can't prove any optimization worked. This step is not optional.
1. **Read the user's code**: Before recommending anything, look at their actual files and project structure. Scan for files >150 lines, check their CLAUDE.md size, and count active MCPs. Recommendations grounded in their real codebase are far more useful than generic advice.
2. **Identify**: Determine the biggest source of waste (large files, bloated CLAUDE.md, accumulated context, too many MCPs)
3. **Recommend**: Suggest the highest-impact optimization from the Quick Wins Checklist
4. **Verify**: After changes, have the user re-run `/context` to measure improvement

**Important guidelines:**
- Always diagnose first — don't dump all optimizations
- Measure before and after — every optimization should be verified with `/context`
- Focus on the user's specific problem — identify the most impactful change first
- Be transparent about trade-offs — modular files save 18%+ on focused tasks but show minimal difference on cross-cutting tasks at small scale

## Usage Examples

### "My Claude Code sessions are getting expensive"

1. Run `/context` to see current token consumption breakdown
2. Audit CLAUDE.md size — if over 500 lines, trim to essentials
3. Check for files >150 lines — identify candidates for splitting
4. Count active MCPs — disable unused ones
5. Review model usage — switch routine tasks to Sonnet/Haiku

### "Organize my codebase for AI"

1. Scan the project for files exceeding 150 lines
2. Identify generic filenames (`utils.ts`, `helpers.ts`, `index.ts` with logic)
3. Propose file splits by responsibility with new descriptive names
4. Suggest a project structure following the organization guide

### "My context window keeps filling up"

1. Run `/context` to identify what's consuming tokens
2. Check if CLAUDE.md has inline documentation that should be referenced instead
3. Recommend `/clear` between tasks and `/compact` for long sessions
4. Suggest moving verbose content to referenced files (lazy loading)

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| No improvement after optimizations | No baseline measurement taken | Run `/context` before AND after each change |
| Don't know how many tokens I'm using | Token consumption not visible by default | Use `/context` to see the full breakdown |
| `/compact` doesn't reduce enough | Compresses but keeps essentials | Use `/clear` if prior context is irrelevant |
| Cross-cutting tasks slower after splitting | Multiple reads needed (1-5% more tokens) | Expected and marginal — focused tasks (80% of work) still save 18%+ |
| API: cache seems not to work, writes every call | Content before breakpoint changes every request (timestamp, session ID, user msg) OR below minimum tokens OR image added/removed | Check `cache_creation_input_tokens` — move volatile content after the breakpoint and meet per-model minimums |
| API: parallel requests all miss cache | Cache entry only exists after first response streams | Fire first request, wait for stream to start, then fan out the rest |
| API: thinking tokens making requests expensive | Default `budget_tokens` can be tens of thousands | Cap `budget_tokens` at 8K-16K, or set `effort: low`, or disable thinking for formatting/lookup tasks |
